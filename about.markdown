Hi Everyone! My name is PD. I work as a Principal Architect- Machine learning at [Quantiphi](https://quantiphi.com/)  based out of Jersey City, NJ. I spend a lot of time building end to end AI systems/products to solve customer problems that involves deep research in LLMs, NLU, Dialog Systems, Knowledge Graphs etc.

Few problems that I am excited about currently :

1. Copilot for developers/ LLM based Dev Tools - we have barely scratched the surface here :) 
2. Copilot for learning - LLM Agents acting as TA/coach to help students read and write better :)
3. Past (~<2023)
    1. Using AI, building AI Tutor Platforms and APIs to help human educators and students, while maintaining instructional quality and high academic standards.
    2. Architecting Tools and Platforms to lower the barrier to use AI/ realise the potential of AI.

Few things/mental models/meta constructs I truly believe in [here]({% link _posts/2024-02-25-somethings-i-believe-in.md %}) 

Music is something that allows me to connect with people easily. Huge fan of Radiohead; You can find what I am listening to [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/prabhudatta?si=45ab750a215445d1)
