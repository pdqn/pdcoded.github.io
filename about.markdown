Hi Readers! My name is PD. I work as a Solutions Architect - Machine Learning at [Quantiphi](https://quantiphi.com/). I  have a great experience in designing and building end-to-end ML systems across multiple domains. I have worked on a wide spectrum of problems from building domain-specific large-scale speech recognition systems for trading floor to architecting efficient NLU systems that can help students get better at comprehending course content. 

Currently, I am working on research in NLP, NLU, Dialog Systems, Knowledge Graphs.

There are two problems that excite me the most, and I spend a lot of time on::

1) Using AI, building Platform and APIs to help human educators and students, while maintaining instructional quality and high academic standards.

2) Architecting Tools and Platforms to lower the barrier to use AI/ realise the potential of AI.


Music is something that allows me to connect with people easily. Huge fan (not limited to) of Radiohead, Coldplay, DireStraits, Pink Floyd, Arcade Fire - You can find what I am listening to [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/prabhudatta?si=45ab750a215445d1)
