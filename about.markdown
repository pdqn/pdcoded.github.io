Hi Everyone! 

I'm PD, working as a Principal Architect in Machine Learning at [Quantiphi](https://quantiphi.com/), based in Jersey City, NJ. My work involves building and architecting end-to-end platforms and products using AI to solve customer problems. This often entails deep research into LLMs, NLU, Dialog Systems, Knowledge Graphs, and more.

## Current Interests

1. Copilots for developers / LLM-based Dev Tools - We've barely scratched the surface here. There's so much potential to rethink the developer experience!
2. Copilots for learning - Exploring how AI can help students learn better and cultivate curiosity.
3. Rethinking workflows in life sciences using AI (part of my day job).
4. Thinking about Neurosymbolic architectures ie how to make LLMs better reasoning agents? (ie solve something like ARC challenge..)

## Past Work (~pre-2023)

1. Building AI Tutor Platforms and APIs to support human educators and students while maintaining high instructional quality and academic standards.
2. Architecting tools and platforms to lower barriers to AI adoption and help realize its potential.

## Personal Beliefs and Interests

I have some core [mental models and meta constructs](/2024/02/25/somethings-i-believe-in.html) that shape my thinking.

When I'm not working, you might find me:
- Jamming on an acoustic guitar
- Discovering new or obscure music
- Going on long runs while listening to podcasts (AI topics, Lex Friedman, Peter Attia, Rick Rubin, etc.)
- Reading non-fiction (AI, Neuroscience, Sleep Science, Longevity, biographies). I am currently reading - The Hidden Spring by Mark Solms
- Searching for the perfect cup of coffee (to maximize working memory!)

## Music

Music is my way of connecting with people. I'm a huge fan of diverse artists like Radiohead, RHCP, Foo Fighters, Arctic Monkeys, Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, Arcade Fire.
