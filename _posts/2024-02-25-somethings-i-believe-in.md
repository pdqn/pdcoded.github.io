1. For me to be truly motivated by something, it has to be my own or at the least something that I am truly passionate about and have a very high skin in the game
2. I generally don’t enjoy working on something that’s not aligned with the kind of work that fulfills me. 
3. I derive great joy in building something that truly solves a problem → Want to have an everlasting curiosity in building something people truly want.
4. I believe more in trying out stuff/implementing rather than too much theorizing. When you try things out, you learn something new about the problem space ie what works and what doesn’t work, what was easy and what was extremely challenging etc.
5. I think doing hard things feels good. I would like to choose asymmetric opportunities anytime.
7. I get super excited working with intense, driven , passionate people who can figure it all out. 
8. I love building stuff, products, technology - the fact that I get to do that day in, day out is incredible. I love the act of creation. It’s an amazing intoxicating feeling 
9. I like to reason using first priciples to most problems.   
10. Running is life altering.
11. I am gonna generally continue to act as if I have free will.
12. Good habits have net cost early but crazy gains later ; Inverse is true for bad habits
