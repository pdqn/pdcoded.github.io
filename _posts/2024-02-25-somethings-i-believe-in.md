1. For me to be truly motivated by something, it has to be my own or at the least something that I am truly passionate about and have a very high skin in the game
2. I generally don’t enjoy working on something that’s not aligned with the kind of work that fulfills me.
3. I derive great joy in building something that truly solves a problem. The fact that I get to do that in some form, day in, day out is incredible. I love the act of creation. It’s an amazing intoxicating feeling.
4. I like to reason using first principles to most problems.
5. Creativity starts when we truly internalise a concept, tool, idea, principle and question it , use it or improve it in a ton of context.
6. [How to learn faster] I believe  in trying out stuff/implementing or grounding research by building applications rather than extreme theorizing or working on toy problems. When you try things out, you learn something new about the problem space ie what works and what doesn’t work, what was easy and what was extremely challenging etc.
7. I think doing hard things feels good. I would like to choose asymmetric opportunities anytime.
8. I get super excited working with a small group of intense, driven , passionate people who can figure it all out.
9. Running is life altering.
10. I am gonna generally continue to act as if I have free will.
11. Good habits have net cost early but crazy gains later ; Inverse is true for bad habits
12. [On AI] Intelligence is the most crucial currency and the ability to augment it with AI is one of the greatest pursuits for mankind.
